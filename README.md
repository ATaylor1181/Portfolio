<h3>The purpose </h3>

<p> I suppose the final purpose of this page is to inform prospective employers and anyone with an interest who I am, and what I can do. </p>

<h3>Functionality/Features </h3>

<p> The page in it's initial stages was going to be a series of interlinked html pages each with a different purpose, that idea was postponed and the current form is of a single page with a footer nav bar used to traverse the page should the user not wish to scroll from top to bottom. </p>

<p> It's features at present are fairly mundane, mostly grids and cards used to display and differentiate between things. The pride of the page however is the header, the swirling animation leading into my logo took some time to figure out, but I am very pleased with how it's turned out. </p>

<p> Future plans for the page include changing it from one page into multiple with an inbuilt gallery so I can show off some of my admittedly amateur photography, that and perhaps some alternate animations, one per page each ending in my logo, but that's a problem for another day. </p>
